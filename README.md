# 👋 Hi, I'm Rayhan

I'm a self-taught and passionate **frontend web developer** with a growing interest in **backend development** and full-stack solutions. I love turning ideas into interactive, responsive, and user-friendly web apps.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🎯 Building real-world frontend projects using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- 🧠 Learning **Node.js** and backend fundamentals deeply — from scratch
- ⚙️ Exploring how things work under the hood — not just using tools, but understanding them
- 🚀 Slowly transitioning toward full-stack development to build complete apps
